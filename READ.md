## Git Lesson

All command line demos are preformed on the MacOS. Creating and editing files is done with TextMate 2 (free) using the mate command from Terminal. 
Passing a file-name to the matecommand will create or open that file.
Windows users can use the notepad file-name command instead.
DESCRIPTION
You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command.
The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.
Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option.
If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given. 
Only the existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset.
If you want to handle the lines that do not match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also EXAMPLES).
